The goal of this project was to bring smartphone sensor data which was collected during a study into a clean and tidy form. 
Moreover some analysis has been done on the different parameters of the dataset. 


The original dataset can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The project in which the data was collected is descirbed here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This repository consists of the following files:

- run_analysis.R -> the R script which transforms the original dataset into the 2 tidy datasets described below. When executing it, make sure that the original dadtaset is in your working directory
- tidy_data.txt -> the tidy dataset
- summary_data.txt -> the tidy dataset with summary calculations of variables
- CodeBook.md -> code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations
